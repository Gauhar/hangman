## Running the application

Finally its time to actually run the app. Running the app is super simple. Itâ€™s a basic hangman so just go and double click the index.html in the project main directory and VOILA you have a running app. 

There is a screen shot of the main screen attached below just to give you an idea that what you should expect. (P.S Ignore the background color, as the color is diffusing into different colors so you might see another color that is generated randomly.) 

Extend to make it more fun. Happy Coding.
